# RTP
## The best and most customizable random teleport plugin.

### Installation
To install this plugin download the latest `.jar` via the [**Releases**](https://github.com/xPolar/RTP/releases) tab on GitHub. Then drag and drop that file into your plugins folder!


### Brief Description
The goal of RTP is to allow complete customizability of random teleportation. This includes what range to teleport in (including world border), teleportation on first join / every join,
teleportation on respawn, as well as chat messages and titles sent to the user.

### [Config File](https://github.com/xPolar/RTP/blob/master/src/main/resources/config.yml)
Messages within the config file can be completely customized including color codes.

To add a block to the `unsafeBlocks` list you must add `- BLOCK_ID` to the list, for example to add `minecraft:grass_block` you would add `- GRASS_BLOCK`, which should look like
```yml
unsafeBlocks:
  - GRASS_BLOCK
```
